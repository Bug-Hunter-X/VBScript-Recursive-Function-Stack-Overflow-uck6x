This repository demonstrates a common error in VBScript: stack overflow due to unbounded recursion.  The `f` function recursively calls itself without a proper termination condition when 'a' is not equal to 1. This leads to a stack overflow when the function is called with a sufficiently large argument (like 5 in the example). The solution shows how to correct the recursive function to avoid the error.
